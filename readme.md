## 🧠 Development Story <a name="development-story"></a>

<details>
<summary>Show Development Story</summary>

This website was brought to life in a total of **10 hours**, split into an initial rapid development sprint and a final polishing phase, showcasing the power of modern AI-assisted workflows.

-   **Phase 1: Initial 6-Hour Sprint**
    -   **Conceptualization & Styling (Claude):** The initial design direction, layout ideas, and overall aesthetic were sketched out with the help of Claude. Its ability to generate creative and coherent styling concepts provided the foundational look and feel for the project.
    -   **Intensive Development (Gemini & Cursor):** The bulk of the coding—including the HTML structure, final CSS implementation, and all JavaScript logic—was hammered out in a highly productive session using a combination of Google's Gemini and Cursor. This AI pairing was instrumental in refining the initial concepts and writing clean code for interactive features like the i18n switcher and initial lightbox.

-   **Phase 2: Polishing & Deployment (4 hours)**
    -   Following the initial build, this stage involved deploying the site to GitHub Pages, tackling hosting-specific issues, and conducting a thorough UX/UI polish. Key improvements included adding dynamic, multilingual captions to the image lightbox, ensuring a consistent layout across all pages, and consolidating project assets for streamlined maintenance and self-contained deployment.

The entire process, from concept to a fully functional and deployed multi-language site in just 10 hours, serves as a testament to the efficiency of AI-augmented development.
